Introduction
------------
This is TeamCodeBad's NinjaFileTransferTool, a Java program to allow two computers to send and receive files from each other. This application was created for the Computer Networking course CS380, taught by Professor David A. Gershman. Project specifics are located at https://www.cpp.edu/~dagershman/cs380/#orgheadline30

Abstract
--------
The file transfer program must implement transmission with integrity, encryption, and optionally ASCII Armoring. The Sender and Receiver must authenticate before transfer. Chunk size transfer must be 1Kb - 1MB, check-summed, hashed for integrity, and encrpyted using an XOR cipher. Failed transfers must try again. Other details found on the project description page.
